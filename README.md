# School Data Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive analysis of school and course data, providing valuable insights into various aspects of the educational system. The project is hosted on GitHub and deployed using Jekyll.

## Overview

The project involves the use of R programming language and several libraries including `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `shiny`, `shinythemes`, and `DT` to analyze and visualize the data. The data is read from a CSV file and processed to extract unique departments, professors, and courses. 

## Features
