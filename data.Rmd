## by analysis

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide',message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
bu_data <- read_csv("data/bu.csv", guess_max = 1001)#, col_types = cols(level_difficulty = col_integer()))
#bu_data <- read.csv("data/bu.csv", col_types = cols_only(prof_name = col_character(), school = col_character(), course_name = col_character(), rate_prof = col_double(), level_difficulty = col_double(), take_again = col_character(), attendence = col_character(), comments = col_character(), hw_level = col_integer()))
```


```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
bu_data %>% ggplot(aes(x=hw_level)) + geom_bar(width=0.7)
p <- bu_data %>% filter(tDept =="Physics department") %>% filter(str_detect(course_name, "PY")) %>% group_by(course_name) %>% summarise(avg_diff = mean(level_difficulty), avg_hw = mean(hw_level)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=avg_diff, y=avg_hw, color = course_name)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "average difficulty", y = "average hw level")

ggplotly(p)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
